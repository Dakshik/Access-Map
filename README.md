# Access Map

## Inspiration
Dakshi was inspired to create this platform after witnessing how challenging it was for her dad to get around in a wheelchair, struggling with the features on his phone, and relying entirely on the wheelchair. This motivated her to create AccessMap, a web app that helps wheelchair users find routes to travel freely and independently. 

## What it does
Access Map highlights accessible pathways, elevators, and ramps while allowing users to report obstacles like blocked ramps or broken elevators. Users can also upvote or downvote reports to ensure accuracy, making the app a community-driven accessibility solution.

## How we built it
Google Maps API for route mapping and displaying accessibility features
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend development
Node.js for backend functionality
## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was implementing Google Maps API. Setting up the API key took longer than expected, and getting it to function correctly required troubleshooting authentication issues and adjusting permissions. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully integrating Google Maps API to display wheelchair-friendly routes
- Designing an easy-to-use and lightweight interface that prioritizes accessibility
- Overcoming technical difficulties in API implementation and data storage
## What we learned
- How to work with Google Maps API and troubleshoot authentication and permissions issues
- The importance of user-centered design when creating an app for accessibility
- The value of working as a team to overcome unexpected technical challenges

## What's next for Access Map
We see a lot of potential for AccessMap and want to continue improving it with:

- More detailed accessibility filters, such as incline steepness and surface conditions
- Offline support for users navigating areas with limited internet access
- Business accessibility ratings, allowing users to check if places have ramps, elevators, or accessible 
   restrooms
- Machine learning integration to analyze accessibility reports and suggest improvements
- Mobile app version for a smoother experience on the go
